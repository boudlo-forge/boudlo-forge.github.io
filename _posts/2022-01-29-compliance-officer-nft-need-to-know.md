**Hello**, in this, my first blog post in a series of articles on emerging technologies and their effect on the compliance space, I will be trying to explain what NFTs are, and now to consider them in terms of your regular business activities.
I hope you find it helpful. 

## So, what the hell is an NFT?

It's a Non-Fungible Token of course, you know how you hate when your tokens get funged? No? Sounds completely incomprehensible? Don't worry, you're not alone.

You have probably heard of cryptocurrencies, or at the very least Bitcoin. There are a lot of them around but only some are suitable for NFTs, the original and biggest is Etherium (or ETH for short). Like pounds/dollars/euros/etc a unit of Etherium is mutually interchangeable with each other, they are *fungible*.

### So how do you make something non-fungible?

**This is an over-simplified analogy, and it's not 100% accurate, but it's the easiest way I can think of to explain it.** Say you took twenty five individual dollar bills and glued them together into a flip book. On each page of the money flip book you write one letter of a web address. At that web address is a piece of media like a picture, video or audio file. Thats basically how an NFT works, in relation to a cryptocurrency like Etherium.
