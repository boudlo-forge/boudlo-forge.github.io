**Hello**, in this, my first blog post in a series of articles on emerging technologies and their effect on the compliance space, I will be trying to explain what NFTs are, and now to consider them in terms of your regular business activities. I hope you find it helpful.

## What *is* an NFT?

It's a Non-Fungible Token of course, you know how you hate when your tokens get funged? No? Sounds completely incomprehensible? Don't worry, you're not alone.

You have probably heard of cryptocurrencies, or at the very least Bitcoin. There are a lot of them around but only some are suitable for NFTs, the original and biggest when it comes to NFTs is Ethereum (or ETH for short). Like pounds/dollars/euros/etc a regular unit of Ethereum is mutually interchangeable with each other, they are *fungible*.

### So how do you make something non-fungible?

**This is an over-simplified analogy, and it's not 100% accurate, but it's the easiest way I can think of to explain it.** Say you took twenty five individual dollar bills and glued them together into a flip book. On each page of the money flip book you write one letter of a web address. At that web address is a piece of media like a picture, video or audio file. Thats basically what an NFT is, and how it works, in relation to a cryptocurrency like Ethereum.

### That's it?

Yeah basically. It's now a unique line on the big Ethereum ledger in the cloud, and it's not directly interchangeable with regular ETH tokens. And yes, it's just a link. It's a common misconception that the media itself is stored on the blockchain ledger, but this isn't so. To store the data required for a whole file it would cost a huge amount of ETH.

### Where's the value?

The value here is **completely arbitrary**. This is actually where NFTs are most like real artworks. The value is entirely defined by what someone is willing to pay to have the NFT in their Ethereum wallet. One very common reason that people buy NFTs is really nothing to do with the media attached, instead, the NFT is basically just functioning as a membership card or VIP pass for something.
