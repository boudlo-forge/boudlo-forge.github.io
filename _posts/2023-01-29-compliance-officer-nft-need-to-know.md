**Hello**, in this, my first blog post in a series of articles on emerging technologies and their effect on the compliance space, I will be trying to explain what NFTs are, and now to consider them in terms of your regular business activities. I hope you find it helpful.

> **The Short Answer:**  
> They're like any asset with subjective value; think football cards or beanie babies. They are typically linked to a media file like an image, video or audio file. They do not contain the media they link to. They don't intrinsically confer any IP rights to the media they link to. The market is rampant with hacks, scams, fakes and fraud. Anyone can open multiple anonymous 'wallets' and trade them between to fake sales and inflate value. This can appear like legitimate purchases on the 'ledger'. There is a high risk of money laundering. Marketing NFTs to consumer investors is likely to be frowned on by regulators, due to their highly volatile and complex nature.

## What *is* an NFT?

It's a Non-Fungible Token of course, you know how you hate when your tokens get funged? No? Sounds completely incomprehensible? Don't worry, you're not alone.

You have probably heard of cryptocurrencies, or at the very least Bitcoin. There are quite a few different cryptocurrencies around but only some are suitable for NFTs, the original and biggest when it comes to NFTs is [Ethereum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp) (or ETH for short). Like pounds/dollars/euros/etc a regular unit of Ethereum is mutually interchangeable with each other, they are *fungible*.

### So how do you make something non-fungible?

**This is an over-simplified analogy, and it's not 100% accurate, but it's the easiest way I can think of to explain it.** Say you took twenty five individual dollar bills and glued them together into a flip book. On each page of the money flip book you write one letter of a web address. If you go to that web address you get a piece of media like a picture, video or audio file. Thats basically what an NFT is, and how it works, in relation to a cryptocurrency like Ethereum.

### That's it?

Yeah basically. It's now a unique line on the big Ethereum ledger in the cloud, and it's not directly interchangeable with regular ETH tokens. And yes, it's just a link to a file on the web somewhere. It's a common misconception that the media itself is stored on the blockchain ledger, but this is not the case. To store the data required for a whole file it would cost a huge amount of ETH.

### Where's the value?

The value here is **completely arbitrary**. This is actually where NFTs are most like real artworks. The value is entirely defined by what someone is willing to pay to have the NFT in their Ethereum wallet. One very common reason that people buy NFTs is really nothing to do with the media attached, instead, the NFT is basically just functioning as a membership card or VIP pass for something.  

## What are the risks?

### As a client's stated *source of wealth*

Be *very* careful here. It may be that your client has legitimately made money from NFTs **but** it's also trivial to open multiple wallets and trade between them. The most popular marketplace, [opensea.io](opensea.io), has absolutely no CDD requirements. As you might imagine, this has already been used for the purpose of pump-and-dump style scams. The only time CDD will have typically been required is if someone bought the Ethereum from an *established* exchange. Why did I emphasise "established"? [You can of course buy cryptocurrency with cash](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/en/buy-bitcoins-with-cash/).

So for a hypothetical criminal, trying to launder criminal proceeds into a legitimate institution, they might:
1. Set up cryptocurrency wallet No.1 with *no due diligence*
2. Buy cryptocurrency with *cash*
3. Set up wallet No.2 and generate (or "mint") an NFT attached to some awful randomly generated image
4. Buy it from themselves with cryptocurrency from wallet No.1
5. Cash out (sell the cryptocurrency) on a legitimate exchange (with CDD)

How much does one NFT sell for? The most expensive sale at the time of writing was Pak's 'The Merge', pictured below, at an equivalent of $91.8m, yes, **Ninety One Point Eight Million Dollars**. So basically, the sky is the limit. My advice would be not to accept NFT sales as a client source of wealth without being very sure that the sale and transactions surrounding it were legitimate.
